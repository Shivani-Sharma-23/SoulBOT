Welcome to SoulBOT, a revolutionary mental health app developed by  Shivani and Sneha . SoulBOT is designed to provide a holistic approach to well-being by combining advanced generative AI algorithms with personalized features aimed at enhancing communication with therapists.

## Features:

### 1. **Voice and Sign Language Communication:**
   - Engage with an AI bot that communicates using a cloned voice and sign language generation.

### 2. **Counseling Sessions:**
   - **Individualized Voice Cloning:**
     - Users have the option to upload a specific voice or select a voice profile that resonates with them. The app employs advanced voice cloning technology to replicate the therapist's voice in the chosen style, providing a comforting and personalized experience.
     - This personalized voice feature aims to enhance the comfort and connection users feel during counseling sessions.

   - **Bot-Mediated Therapy Sessions:**
     - To address concerns about judgment or anxiety, users have the option to engage in therapy sessions facilitated by a bot. The bot acts as an intermediary, providing a secure and non-judgmental space for users to express themselves.
     - These bot-mediated sessions can serve as a stepping stone for users before transitioning to sessions with human therapists, fostering a gradual and comfortable experience.

   - **Flexible Session Formats:**
     - Users can choose between voice-only sessions, video sessions with or without personalized voice cloning, and sign language sessions.
     - This flexibility ensures that users have the freedom to select the communication format that best suits their comfort and preferences.

     - The app provides a matching algorithm that considers user preferences, therapy goals, and communication preferences to pair users with therapists who align with their needs.
     - Users can view therapist profiles, including their specialties, communication style, and availability.
    
   - **Feedback and Ratings:**
     - After each session, users have the opportunity to provide feedback and ratings for their therapists. This helps improve the matching algorithm and ensures quality assurance.

   - **Sign Language Integration:**
     - For users who prefer or require sign language communication, a dedicated option is available. By selecting this option, users can engage in counseling sessions with therapists who communicate using sign language.
     - The video feed during these sessions includes a split-screen view, displaying both the user's video and the therapist's sign language communication.

   - **Session History and Progress Tracking:**
     - The app maintains a secure history of counseling sessions, allowing users to reflect on their progress over time.
